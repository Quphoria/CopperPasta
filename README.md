# Copper Pasta

There are currently 2 branches, master and sqlite3  
  
As I wish to make the project more expandable and a flat database such as sqlite3 is quite slow,  
I have decided to make the master branch for use with mysql,  
while keeping the sqlite3 branch for allowing users to tinker with the project without the need to setup a database
